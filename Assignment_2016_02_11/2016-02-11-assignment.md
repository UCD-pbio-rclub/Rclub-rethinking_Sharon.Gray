## 2E4: This statement means that, on any given toss, the probability of observing water is 0.7.
#One could make the argument that it doesn't have an objective reality because it's inference
#space is the toss that is occurring at that moment.

## 2M3: Pr(p|w)=Pr(w|p)*Pr(p)/Pr(w)
#Pr(Earth|land)=Pr(land|earth)*Pr(earth)/Pr(land)
#Pr(Earth|land)=0.3*0.5/0.65
#Pr(Earth|land)=0.23

## 2M4:
card 1: black & black
card 2: black & white
card 3: white & white

outcome: black side is facing up
card 1: 2 ways to produce the outcome
card 2: 1 way to produce the outcome
card 3: 0 ways to produce the outcome

Plausability of [card with 2 black sides] after seeing one black side = 
number of ways that [card with 2 black sides] can produce the one black side outcome
*
prior plausability of [card with 2 black sides]

Plausability of [card with 2 black sides] after seeing one black side = 2 * 1/3 = 2/3
