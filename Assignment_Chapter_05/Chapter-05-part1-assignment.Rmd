# Statistical Rethinking Chapter 4 problems

__Name:__Sharon Gray


# For 04/11/2016

## 5E1
2, 3 and 4 are multiple linear regressions.


## 5E2
mu <- a + b1*p.diversity + b2*latitude


## 5M1
plant_growth_rate <- a + b1*CO2 + b2*talking_to_plants 


## 5M3
When the divorce rate is high, more people will have multiple marriages in their lifetime, resulting in a higher marriage rate. We could evaluate this using predictor residual plots.  


## 5M4
merge is better than cbind because you can use by statements to make sure it lines up
```{r}
setwd("/Users/sharongray/Rclub-rethinking_Sharon.Gray/Assignment_Chapter_05")
LDS <- read.csv("LDS.csv")
library(rethinking)
data(WaffleDivorce)
LDS_marriage <- merge(LDS, WaffleDivorce, by.x="Location", by.y="Location")
#LDS_marriage <-cbind(LDS, WaffleDivorce)
head(LDS_marriage)
#standardize variables
LDS_marriage$Marriage.s <- (LDS_marriage$Marriage - mean(LDS_marriage$Marriage))/sd(LDS_marriage$Marriage)
LDS_marriage$MedianAgeMarriage.s <- (LDS_marriage$MedianAgeMarriage - mean(LDS_marriage$MedianAgeMarriage))/sd(LDS_marriage$MedianAgeMarriage)
LDS_marriage$percent_LDS.s <- (LDS_marriage$percent_LDS - mean(LDS_marriage$percent_LDS))/sd(LDS_marriage$percent_LDS)
#model where divorce is predicted by marriage rate, median marriage age, and percent LDS
#each beta is normally distributed with a mean of 0 and SD of 1
#the intercept is normally distributed with a mean of 10 and SD of 10
#sigma is uniformly distributed
model_LDS <- map(
    alist(
      Divorce ~ dnorm(mu, sigma),
      mu <- a + bR*Marriage.s + bA*MedianAgeMarriage.s + bL*percent_LDS.s,
      a ~ dnorm(10, 10),
      bR ~ dnorm(0, 1),
      bA ~ dnorm(0,1),
      bL ~ dnorm(0,1),
      sigma ~ dunif(0,10)
    ) ,
    data = LDS_marriage)
precis(model_LDS)
plot(precis(model_LDS))
    ```
    head(LDS)
